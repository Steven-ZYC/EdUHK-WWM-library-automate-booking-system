## Introduction

To enhance our EdUHK students’ experience and streamline our WWM Library’s booking process, we propose our project, **an Automated Booking System for EdUHK WWM Library.** This program will allow students to easily search for available seats, reserve them, and manage their bookings efficiently in EdU WWM library.

## Objectives

1.	Simplify Booking Process: Create an intuitive interface for students to book library seats effortlessly.
2.	Real-time Availability: Provide real-time information on seat availability, reducing time spent searching for spaces.
3.	Automated Reservations: Enable regular bookings for students, accommodating their study schedules.
4. User Notifications: Generate a calendar file that students can import to most of calendar apps, thus can remind individuals for upcoming bookings. (TBA)

   ## Features

   - [x] User-Friendly Interface: A lite CLI for easy access and navigation.
   - [x] Automated Booking: Students can set up recurring bookings based on their schedules.
   - [x] High efficiency: Students can book a series if seats or facilities within a second in stead of click the webpage one by one for a few minutes.

   ## Conclusion

   The Automated Library Seat Booking System is hopeful to significantly enhance the library experience for students, making it easier to find and reserve study spaces. By implementing this program, our university can improve resource utilization and support students' academic success. We believe that with the right resources and support, this initiative will be a valuable addition to our university's services.
